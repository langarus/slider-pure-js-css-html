# Silder made with pure html css js
I've made this slider to be able to use it across multiple projects

## Features:
1. Working with pure HTML CSS JS
2. Using async/promise to make a setTimeout function syncronous
3. It realises when you hover over the slider and stops
4. It changes the images automatically
5. It allows the user to use buttons to change the image, and the slider's main function will take that into consideration
6. There is a a 5% section on the left and right, so you won't have to select the button to be able to change the picture
7. The buttons only appear when the mouse is hovering

## For future versions:
1. At this point I'm usign Line Awesome for buttons, that can be improved to some locally stored buttons
